<h1>Live Coding</h1>

<p>This repo contains multiple live coding practice problems. Each folder is one problem. A description of the problem will be found in the form of a readme. There is also a solutions folder that contains a possible solution for the problem in Python3, Java, C#, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>These problems were created as a way for LaunchCode students to practice Live Coding in a classroom setting.</p>

<p>To truly practice students should follow the steps of a live coding session as defined by LaunchCode:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Gather Requirements/Clairfy Problem</li>
    <li>Break Problem Down</li>
    <li>Psuedocode</li>
    <li>Real Code</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>Changes</li>
</ol>

<p>Students should also emulate the live coding setting by not using: a computer, an IDE, Google, StackOverFlow, Documentation, or their existing projects.</p>
